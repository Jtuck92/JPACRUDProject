# JPACRUDProject

## Overview
This program was written as a Week-9 homework assignment for Skill Distillery. Its function is to provide the user with a functioning database retrival tool for video games and the titles attached to them. 

## Topics
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Packages
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Array Lists
* Exception Handling
* SQL Database Management
* MySQL Workbench
* Spring Boot Projects
* Gradle Builds
* Queries
* Connecting to Servers

## How To Run

* The program is structured to presernt the available functions graphically.

## Lessons Learned
This project presented the monumental challenege of creating a fully CRUD implemented full-stack application. Building off the toolset of the previous week, this assignment narrowed the workload from a three-man team down to just a single programmer. Hurdles encounted during the previous sprint were repeated, including Spring Boot integration and database mapping. Time became the ulimate obstacle, as tasks mounted and organizing priorty fixes began to consume hours in bunches. In summation, the lessons that were imparted by this assignment were the same ones offered by similar large projects from earlier in the program: time-management, task prioritization, with a healthy dusting of new concepts to befuddle the developer.
